# Getting Started with The User Interface

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# 1. Running The User Interface

1. Navigate to the client directory
```
cd DegreeMap/Client
```
2. Install Node and Npm.
```
https://nodejs.org/en/download
```
3. Copy the `.env` file you added to `DegreeMap/Database` into `DegreeMap/Client` as well.
```
TOKEN="YOUR API TOKEN FOR THE PROD DATA"
USERNAME="YOUR MYSQL USERNAME"
PASSWORD="YOUR MYSQL PASSWORD"
DATABASE_NAME="degreemap"
HOST="localhost"
PORT=3306
APIPORT=3030
SERVERURL="http://localhost:3030"
```
4. Install `yarn`.
```
npm install --global yarn
```
5. Install Dependencies.
```
yarn install
```
6. Start the Environment
```
yarn start
```
7. View the application in your browser.
```
http://localhost:3000
```
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# 2. Stopping the User Interface
1. Use control + C in most systems.

# 3. Features

See the main `DegreeMap/README.md` and the report for the feature list, how to use the application interface, and which files correspond to which features.
